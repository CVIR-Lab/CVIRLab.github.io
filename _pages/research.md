# Research

Our overarching goal is to explore space science. To do so, we use and develop novel techniques and tools to .

Our goal is to build instruments and develop techniques that enable us to address the questions we find most interesting. This is possible thanks also to Milan's broad background with different research themes and technologies: he learned his trade in [Seamus Davis’ SI-STM lab](http://davisgroup.lassp.cornell.edu/) and with [Felix Baumberger](http://dpmc.unige.ch/gr_baumberger/index.html), and later moved as an [ETH fellow](http://www.ethfellows.ethz.ch/) to [Andreas Wallraff’s qudev lab](http://www.qudev.ethz.ch/) where he investigated coupled cavity arrays in circuit QED. We further have group members with different background and interests, working together on computer vision and robots.

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

**Planetary object detection for rover and non-target space object.** We have developed a novel cryogenic MHz amplifier that allows us to measure not only the average tunneling current, but also its fluctuation! This has many applications: one can detect the fluctuations of the electronic states, peculiar tunneling processes, and shot noise. We have used this instrument to discover charge trapping in the insulating layer of the cuprates, connected to the c-axis mystery, and to measure the doubling of the charge due to Andreev processes to the superfluid in a lead sample.


**Bionic optics and robot.** ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/SciPost.png){: style="width: 70%; float: right; margin: 0px"}
Questions of interest include: (i), How does the insect use compound eyes to perceive environmental information and how is this related to the model of visual neural network system? (ii), What is the decision mechanism of insects with compound eyes to avoid obstacles at a fast  spead? Is there a learning-based model to support such a fantastic flying skill? (iii), What can we learning from all living things to build better robots for human kind?

We also have some Open Projects(OP) for Bsc students including object detection and segmentation(OP1), object tracking and avoidance(OP2) and non-contact Medical data measurement on UAV and UGV platfroms, as well as other creative programmes.
