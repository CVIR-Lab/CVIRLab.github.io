  description: "we propose a multi-object tracking framework for videos captured by UAVs, considering motion imperfection in the following two aspects. For motion blurring, this paper proposes a hybrid deblurring module
that deals with the blurred frames while retaining the clear frames, trading off between video tracking performance and spatio-temporal consistency. For motion coupling, we proposed a motion compensation module to align adjacent frames by
feature matching, and the corrected target position is obtained in the next frame to alleviate the interference of camera movement with tracking."

  description: In this paper, we present a new autonomous rock detection approach through region contrast. New method deals with this issue in region level, which will significantly reduce the computational cost. Only low-level features are measured and a more reliable method is further proposed by introducing spatial factor and background similarity to the region contrast.

  description: This paper presents a high altitude hazard detection method for Mars landing. Towards safe landing requirements for future missions, hazard detection should be triggered as soon as possible. We therefore proposed a lidar based high altitude hazard detection approach, consisting of two main procedures, Terrain reconstruction and Hazard mapping. An interpolation based terrain reconstruction algorithm is proposed to model the datum surface of landing region.

  image: 5dof.png
  description: We propose a novel auto rock detection scheme via sparse based background modeling for planetary rover. Instead of pixel level image processing and pre training, we deal with the detection issue by region contrast enhancement. Our method consists of a rough detection algorithm to auto-label conservative background regions and a background modeling algorithm to precisely detect rocks. Background is reconstructed in feature space with the labeled regions as dictionary via sparse representation. Contrast map is enhanced by the error of original image and reconstructed background. Afterwards, rock is directly segmented by an auto threshold.
