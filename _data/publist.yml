- title: "Autonomous rock detection on mars through region contrast"
  image: TBG_SL.png
  description: In this paper, we present a new autonomous rock detection approach through region contrast. Unlike current state-of-art pixel-level rock segmenting methods, new method deals with this issue in region level, which will significantly reduce the computational cost. Image is firstly splitted into homogeneous regions based on intensity information and spatial layout. Considering the high-water memory constraints of onboard flight processor, only low-level features, average intensity and variation of superpixel, are measured. Region contrast is derived as the integration of intensity contrast and smoothness measurement. Rocks are then segmented from the resulting contrast map by an adaptive threshold. Since the merely intensity-based method may cause false detection in background areas with different illuminations from surroundings, a more reliable method is further proposed by introducing spatial factor and background similarity to the region contrast. Spatial factor demonstrates the locality of contrast, while background similarity calculates the probability of each subregion belonging to background. Our method is efficient in dealing with large images and only few parameters are needed. Preliminary experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms edge-based methods in various grayscale rover images.

- title: "Safe Mars landing strategy: Towards lidar-based high altitude hazard detection"
  image: TiNHigh.png
  description: This paper presents a high altitude hazard detection method for Mars landing. Towards safe landing requirements for future missions, hazard detection should be triggered as soon as possible. We therefore proposed a lidar based high altitude hazard detection approach, consisting of two main procedures, Terrain reconstruction and Hazard mapping. An interpolation based terrain reconstruction algorithm is proposed to model the datum surface of landing region.

- title: "Auto rock detection via sparse-based background modeling for mars rover"
  image: dummy.png
  description: We propose a novel auto rock detection scheme via sparse based background modeling for planetary rover. Instead of pixel level image processing and pre training, we deal with the detection issue by region contrast enhancement. Our method consists of a rough detection algorithm to auto-label conservative background regions and a background modeling algorithm to precisely detect rocks. Background is reconstructed in feature space with the labeled regions as dictionary via sparse representation. Contrast map is enhanced by the error of original image and reconstructed background. Afterwards, rock is directly segmented by an auto threshold. Our method is simple yet efficient, primary results show that the proposed algorithm yields highly precise detection results, compared with current state-of-art edge-based algorithms.
